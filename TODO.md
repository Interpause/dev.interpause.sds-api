# TODO

- use \_name convention for private vars
- use Awake() for initializing vars & getting references
- use Start() for setting up behaviours
- Awake is called even if script disabled, Start called on first frame after script enabled
- Ensure all internal functions are private so as to prevent unity excessively refreshing from signature updates
